This is awesome file I added directly from Github.com
and now i am about to commit directly to GIthub.com remote repository
This is not something we would do normally
We are just trying simulate a situation where remote repositpry history is ahead of local reposit=ory history
in plain english remote has one additional commit that local does not have
